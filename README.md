My project to control a toy car through Android using the Bluetooth!

Using a program tailor-made for both Android and Arduino both, used the smartphone's accelerometer to move the toy car!

For now, the commands are:

- Next
- Back
- Right
- Left
- Stop

First version:
It is possible to control only in the digital mode (0V - 5V), then always has the same speed!
